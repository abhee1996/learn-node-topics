//we use tamplate Engine to use show dynamic content in out website
//template engine is also known as views Engine
//To set the views Engine we have to tell the app what views engine im using

app.set("view engine", "hbs");

to use tamplate engine and render tamplate files
set the following application setting properties, set in app.js in the default app created by the generator:
we have to create a views directory its by default, otherwise it would not be used.
-> views, the directory where the template files are located. Eg: app.set('views', './views'). This defaults to the views directory in the application root directory.
-> view engine, the template engine to use. For example, to use the Pug template engine: app.set('view engine', 'pug').
Views: A directory or an array of directories for the application's views. If an array, the views are looked up in the order they occur in the array.

//const viewsPath = path.join(__dirname, "../views");
// app.set("views",viewsPath)
//-> to change the directory name only way it set that directory path as view
const tamplatesPath = path.join(__dirname, "../tamplates");

app.set("views",tamplatesPath)
